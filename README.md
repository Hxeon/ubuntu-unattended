# ubuntu-unattended
A few files I use to make a unattended install of Ubuntu at home and on the go. I like helping people switch to Linux!

Most of the time, every setting I'd use is the same, so i can change the little bit that needs changing afterwards. 

Also sometimes it's for a virtual machine, and I don't feel like clicking every option if it's all the same, 
so might as well automate it!
